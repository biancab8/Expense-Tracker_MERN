# Expense-Tracker
This full-stack application was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  
It allows the user to track their expenses over time, categorize transactions into different accounts, and add a personalized description for each entry.  
The user can add new transactions, edit or delete existing entries, and create their own list of custom categories.  
The app also offers the option to filter the transactions list by category and/or by date range.  
Right below the transactions list, the app automatically creates a bar graph depicting the total expenses per month, as well as a pie chart that breaks down the expenses by category.
